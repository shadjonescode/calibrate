# Calibrate

Calibrate is an AI-driven scheduling app that syncs Canvas and Google Calendar to automatically plan and adjust academic and personal schedules.

## Problem
Students juggling classes, work, and personal life often miss deadlines or struggle to plan consistent study time—especially when schedules change unexpectedly.

## Solution
Calibrate automatically pulls deadlines and events from existing tools and builds a realistic schedule around a user’s availability. A lightweight conversational input allows users to quickly add sudden changes (like work shifts), keeping their schedule accurate without manual effort.

## Status
This project is currently in active development. Core scheduling logic, integrations, and experiments are being built incrementally.
